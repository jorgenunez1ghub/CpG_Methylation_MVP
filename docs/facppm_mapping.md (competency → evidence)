# FAC-P/PM Mid-Level Mapping — Evidence from CpG_Methylation_MVP

## Overview
This repository demonstrates end-to-end project delivery for a data-driven MVP: requirements definition, risk management, implementation oversight, deployment readiness, and stakeholder communication via a repeatable demo.

---

## Competency-to-Evidence Map

### 1) Requirements / Scope Management
**Evidence:**
- `docs/one_pager.md` defines problem, users, scope, out-of-scope, and success criteria.
- Streamlit app workflow enforces a clear user journey (upload → map columns → threshold → results → export).

### 2) Schedule / Delivery Management
**Evidence:**
- Repo structure supports iterative delivery (MVP now; enhancements listed in one-pager “Next Iteration Ideas”).
- Small, deployable increments (code + requirements + runtime + docs) demonstrate phased delivery.

### 3) Risk Management (incl. privacy/safety)
**Evidence:**
- `docs/risk_register.md` identifies privacy, misuse, and reliability risks with mitigations.
- App includes disclaimers and avoids clinical claims (educational framing).

### 4) Quality Management / Verification
**Evidence:**
- Schema checks + column mapping reduce user error.
- Data cleaning (numeric coercion + invalid row handling) improves reliability.
- Exportable outputs support traceability and review.

### 5) Stakeholder Communication
**Evidence:**
- `docs/demo_script.md` provides a consistent, time-boxed briefing.
- README (and in-app guidance) supports onboarding and self-service use.

### 6) Technical Management / Solution Oversight
**Evidence:**
- Implementation demonstrates tool selection and architecture decisions (Streamlit + Pandas).
- `requirements.txt` and `runtime.txt` support environment reproducibility and deployment readiness.

### 7) Governance / Responsible Use
**Evidence:**
- Explicit disclaimers (educational only; not medical advice).
- Controls designed to prevent overreach (rule-based MVP; no automatic medical guidance).
